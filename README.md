# UEVR Mods

Oculus Touch button prompt mods for Praydog's UEVR Injector.  These mods will update in-game button prompts to match Oculus Touch controllers but do not change the gamepad artwork in the main menu. 

* The Aliens: Fireteam Elite mod requires [**Unreal Mod Unlocker Basic**](https://illusory.dev/) as a hard requirement to prevent online matchmaking from being disabled.
* The Martha Is Dead mod also fixes UI black border issues.

## Installation

1) Download a mod from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Ashok0/UEVR-Mods/releases) page.
2) Extract the PAK file and place it in the "Paks" directory in your game folder. (For Steam games, you  can simply extract the contents of the RAR directly to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common) 
3) Inject with UEVR and play the game with Oculus Touch button prompts!

If the button prompts don't work, make sure the in-game controller layout is set to the Xbox controller (Most games will automatically default to an Xbox layout after injection)
